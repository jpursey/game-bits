# Game Bits Templates

This directory contains a number of basic Game Bits templates. To create a new 
project based on these templates, just the copy the directory and run one of the build scripts to create the project.

## Templates

  - **cli**: This template is the most minimal and has nothing but glog 
    initialization in command line application.
  - **sdl**: This template brings up a bare bones SDL application with glog
    integration.

## Examples

For more complete game examples showing fuller integration with Game Bits libraries, see the examples directory parallel to this one.
